# PianotTiles-python-bot

This repository holds the code of creating a python bot on windows, which will play the Piano Tiles game.
If in case you dont know about the game then you can have a demo here https://www.agame.com/game/magic-piano-tiles

In order need to run and successfully execute the following on a fresh system,
Download Python from the official website
Then open command prompt(make sure you run it as administrator) and install the following libraries by running the following commands:-

```pip install pywin32
pip install keyboard
pip install pyautogui
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
pip install winapi
```
Now you have all the required libraries installed 
Now you can check out the cordinates and RGB colour of the columns and tiles by opening IDLE PYTHON from start menu and running 

```
import pyautogui
pyautogui.displayMouseLocation()
```

After this you can edit the cordinates of the tiles/columns according your system and you are ready to go :)

My code runs for this game https://www.agame.com/game/magic-piano-tiles at full screen mode and my cordinates of the tiles are set for screen resolution 1600*900..
